# Moodle Scraper
A scraper for older versions of Moodle.

- Instead of using outdated packages in older version. I am going to use webkit to get a screen capture of the page to retain the nice formatting.
  - currently looking at packages:
    1. `PyQt`
    2. `PySide`
    3. `Ghost`
  - These packages don't really support login right now. Might have to find a work around.
- [Probably low priority] And A pdf file will be created containing all the screenshots of a course.
- Investigate structure of older versions of moodle to get the files `.doc . pdf etc`
- Replace redirect links with actual target.
